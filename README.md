## Abstract
This project investigates the integration of active perception strategies in robotic systems to improve face recognition capabilities. By enabling a robot to navigate and adjust its viewpoint actively, the system aims to capture more informative visual data, leading to enhanced recognition performance. The approach combines multi-task learning techniques within a simulated environment to validate the effectiveness of active perception in face recognition tasks.
